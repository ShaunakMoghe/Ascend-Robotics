# üèãÔ∏è Lifts

Lifts are any mechanism that raises one part of the robot up, usually to score points or to achieve some other purpose.

One of the most common types of lifts is the four-bar. This simple lift raises up a small bar, while keeping it parallel to it's initial position.&#x20;

Another variant of the four-bar is the double reverse four-bar (DR4B). This type of lift uses two four-bars in tandem that lift the desired mechanism up even higher.

To build a four-bar, connect two C-channels in parallel as shown in the videos.
