# ðŸ¥Š Boxing

Boxing is an advanced build technique that improves the stability of a connection. The basic idea is to prevent a C-channel from bending by supporting it at two points rather than one. This is done with a long screw and 7/8" of spacing on the inside of a C-channel.

Here's an intake before and after boxing. In the picture to the left, the C-channel bent under heavy defense. It was fixed in the picture to the right by boxing, and the C-channel never bent again.

We also recommend boxing the cross-braces on the drivetrain as shown below. This prevents the drive C-channels from bending and makes the robot more durable.
