# ðŸ“— Engineering Notebook

The engineering notebook is the piÃ¨ce de rÃ¨sistance of a VEX team. From the engineering notebook, one should be able to follow the **entire** design process of a team. At a basic level, the notebook should have:

* Analysis of the **game**
* Possible **designs**
* **Selection** of the best design
* Step-by-step documentation of the **building** process
* The full **code** for the robot
* **Testing** and test results
* Project **management** notes

In this section, we will be using team 96504C's Spin Up notebook as an example. While this notebook did earn 4 Excellence Awards, it is not a perfect notebook. Still, it's a good starting point.
