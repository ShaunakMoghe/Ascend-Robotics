# ðŸ“” Formatting

There are many programs that can be used to create Engineering Notebooks: Google Docs, Google Slides, Word, Notion, etc. We recommend Google Docs because it is easy to collaborate with others, but any word processor will work. For competitions, print out the notebook and put the pages in a 3-ring binder.

Here's an example of a well-formatted notebook page. The green annotations highlight the good aspects of this notebook page

Some of the important elements of **every** notebook page:

* Header / footer with section number
* Header / footer with page number
* Digital signatures with dates of contribution

Additionally, make sure to include a table of contents at the beginning of the notebook, so that it's easy to find sections in the notebook. See the next page, "Notebook Walkthrough" for more information.
