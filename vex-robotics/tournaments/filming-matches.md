# ðŸ“· Filming Matches

You should film **every** match. Why? Because later, after the tournament, you will:

* Analyze **why** and how the robot **broke** or malfunctioned
* Reflect on your team's game **strategy** and compare it to other strategies
* Study other team's **effective** robots and game strategies

There are 120 seconds in a match--15 for autonomous, 105 for driver control. Examine the videos carefully; did you **waste** a single second? What can be improved on the robot? Do you need more driver practice?

Yes, that's a high standard. That's what it takes to win. Don't waste a single second.
