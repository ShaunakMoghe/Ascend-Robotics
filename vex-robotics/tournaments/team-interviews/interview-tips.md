But, success requires knowing more than just what is on there, it requires knowing how to approach it as well. Here are some interview tips for success:

1. Delegate each teammate to a specific part of the rubric. Doing this allows for a clean organization of who will say what during the interview, and will reduce teammates talking over each other, which can cost you points
2. Not every teammate has to be at the interview. If not all teammates are comfortable with the interview or if you have a big team, not everybody needs to be present at the interview since all present members are expected to contribute meaningfully to the interview process, which can be hard if there are too many or are uncomfortable with it.&#x20;
3. Focus on what makes you stand out. The interview is also a time to show what makes your team unique from the others, so if you have an unorthodox method of solving a problem make sure to emphasize why you chose that method and why your team uses it.
4. Don't get stressed. Remember, this isn't a job interview where you'll be asked questions you don't know the answer to. This is a robotics interview so everything will be about robotics, so if you know how your robot works you will be fine.&#x20;
5. Keep track of time since the interview only lasts 10 minutes. You can have a great interview without using all the time but if you run out of time you could potentially miss out on the 8 rubric points given. Be sure to keep a rough outline of how much time you will allot to different components of your robot and design.&#x20;
6. Don't be afraid to let your personality shine. The interview is your team's chance to stand out from the rest of the competitors and show what is unique about you and your team that the robot can't show. Just make sure you keep it in control and the conversation still covers what is needed for the points in the rubric.&#x20;
