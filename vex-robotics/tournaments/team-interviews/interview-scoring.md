Let's go through each of the categories:

1. Engineering Design Process - The engineering design process is the backbone of robotics and is critical to success. To get a good score, you need to show definitive proof that you used this process in your notebook and you can explain how you used it to make your robot.\
   You can learn more about the engineering design process here: [https://vrc-kb.recf.org/hc/en-us/articles/9628278280215-VRC-Engineering-Design-Process](https://vrc-kb.recf.org/hc/en-us/articles/9628278280215-VRC-Engineering-Design-Process)
2. Game Strategies - To gain this point you need to showcase that you came into this competition with a plan on how you were going to play and what factors affected this plan and how.&#x20;
3. Robot Design - This one goes a bit hand in hand with the engineering design process and shows that your team actually utilized it in the building of the robot. To get this point, you need to showcase how you got from your initial robot design to your current robot design and how and why the design changed.
4. Robot Build - To gain this point, you have to show that you are knowledgeable about your team's bot and know its ins and outs. To earn this point, you will need to be able to answer any questions the judges might have about your robot's build and parts.&#x20;
5. Robot Programming - This one follows the same pattern as the build, where you need to be able to explain in depth how your robot's programming works to earn the point.
6. Team and Project Management - To earn this point you need to show that you took measures to keep your team operations on track and managed the project properly to maintain optimal efficiency
7. Teamwork, Communication, Professionalism - To earn this point, your team needs to perform well in the interview itself. This can be done by avoiding talking over one another, communicating clearly with confidence, and being professional. More importantly, every team member must contribute meaningfully to the interview questions being asked.
8. Respect, Courtesy, Positivity - This point comes from your attitude during the interview. If your team is doing the interview with positivity, interest, and respectfulness, you will earn the point.
