# ðŸ•‘ Time Management

Time is always moving and always limited. In Robotics, time management is a crucial part of success, since **you always have less time than you think**. Thus, it is important to allocate time effectively.

Firstly, it's important to create a plan so that your team knows what to expect and when to expect it. A good plan helps your team stay on task and lays out the foundations of what they will be doing for the foreseeable future.&#x20;

One of the ways to establish a good plan is through making a timeline via a GANTT Chart.

A GANTT chart outlines the different phases of the design process and details how much time is devoted to each phase. For example, we allocated the first half of May for brainstorming and design, and the second half for prototyping.

It is important to note that every team's GANTT Chart will be different since every team has their own unique goals that will likely vary from team to team.&#x20;

Setting timely goals is the key to success.
