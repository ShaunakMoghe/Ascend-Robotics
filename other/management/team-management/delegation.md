# ðŸ‘® Delegation

In a team there are a few roles you can designate to team members:

* Captain
* Driver
* Analyst
* Programmer
* Designer
* Builder
* Tester
* Notebooker

This isn't an exhaustive list of roles, and you can pretty much assign any role to any team member as long as it fits your team's goals and purposes. The roles listed above will exist in some shape or form in every team since every team needs people to perform these tasks.&#x20;

Let's take a look at each of these roles and see what they do:

* Captain - The captain manages team operations, ensuring everyone contributes to success. They carry significant responsibility, so choose an experienced, committed member.
* Driver - Drives the robot, of course!
*   Analyst - Analyzing test data and matching observations is vital for team improvement. It guides what to maintain and change.

    Programmer - Responsible for robot programming, making it functional and mobile.
* Designer - Designing the robot is vital; CAD skills are beneficial. A well-designed robot is crucial for competition success.
* Builder - Builders construct the robot based on the designer's plans.
* Tester - Conducts experiments, crucial for testing new robot parts. Data collected guides improvements, analyzed by the analyst.
* Notebooker - Creating an outstanding engineering notebook is critical, as it can lead to awards like the Design Award, a path to the World Championship in VEX Robotics.

## How to delegate?

Generally, it will be the **captain's job to delegate** roles to teammates since it is the captain's job to manage team operations. Once again, make sure that your team's captain has the most time to devote to robotics since they will have the most commitment out of anybody else. Drivers should also be decided by a similar category to a captain in that they also need to have a lot of time to devote to the team and should ideally have a bit of prior controller experience. All the other roles should preferably be assigned based on team member preference to make sure teammates are happy with their roles. Otherwise, it will be up to the captain to decide which teammate will have the best performance in which role.&#x20;
