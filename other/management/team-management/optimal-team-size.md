# âš“ Optimal Team Size

The **optimal team size** is **4-5 members**. This is the ideal size for team members who have time to commit to robotics. Anything more than 5 starts to result in problems; not every team member can contribute to the team.&#x20;

But, this isn't a steadfast rule because there are times when smaller or larger teams can also work fine.

A **team of 2-3** members can work if robotics is part of your free time and you are willing to spend numerous hours every single day in the week towards Robotics.

A **team of 6+** can work if not all team members have enough time to commit to robotics, so more members allow the workload to be lighter on each teammate.&#x20;

Regardless of the size of your team, you need to ask yourself the underlying question: **can this team size fulfill the objectives of robotics that have been set aside?**&#x20;

If your answer is **NO**: then you probably need more members so you can complete whatever your objective is.

If your answer is **YES**: then you are good to go!
