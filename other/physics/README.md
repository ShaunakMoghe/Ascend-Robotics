# üçé Physics

Physics is the study of the motion and nature of objects. Obviously, this plays a huge role in Robotics.

One of the primary concepts from physics is the idea of force. At a base level, a **force is a push or pull that makes an object change direction.**

* The wheels of the robot apply a force on the ground, which pushes the robot forward
* Rubber bands impart force on a catapult arm, causing it to slam upward
* An intake exerts a force on a game object, making it move in a different direction

The two most important applications of force are **torque** and **stress forces**. Torque is simply rotational force, and stress forces are internal to the robot.&#x20;
